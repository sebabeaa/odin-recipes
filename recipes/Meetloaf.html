    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>This is the best meatloaf recipe ever and comes complete with a yummy glaze.
         It will knock your socks off! My mom never ever made meatloaf when I was growing up 
         so when I moved out on my own, I started experimenting with different recipes and this is my best creation.</p>

    <br>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>

       <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
       <li>1/4 cup minced onion </li>
       <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
       <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
       <li>1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper</li>
       <li>2 pounds extra-lean ground beef</li>
       <li>3 slices bread, toasted and crumbled</li>
       <li>7 buttery round crackers, crushed</li>
       <li>1 egg, lightly beaten</li>
       <li>3 ½ tablespoons sour cream</li> 

       <li> 1 ½ tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>

       <li>1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce, divided</li>

       <li>¼ cup milk, or as needed (Optional)</li>

       <li>3 tablespoons ketchup</li>

    </ul>

    <br>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>

        <li> the butter in a skillet over medium heat, and cook onion and garlic until onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat, and season with salt and pepper.</li>

        <li>Combine onion and garlic mixture, beef, crumbled bread, crushed crackers, egg, sour cream, Worcestershire sauce, and 1/2 can tomato sauce in a large bowl. Mix until well combined. Gradually stir in milk, 1 teaspoon at a time, until mixture is moist, but not soggy. Transfer the mixture to a 5x9 inch loaf pan.</li>

        <li> uncovered in the preheated oven for 40 minutes. Increase oven temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C), and continue baking 15 minutes, to an internal temperature of 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>

        <li>Mix the remaining tomato sauce and ketchup in a small bowl. Pour over the top of the meatloaf, and continue baking for 10 minutes.</li>
